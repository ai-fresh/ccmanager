# CC Gate

> CC Gate is a free, open-source macOS menu bar application for monitoring and managing Claude Code sessions. It provides 4-tier auto-accept permissions (Read, Write, Execute, Plan), live session status tracking, and a native question management UI — so Claude Code can keep working while you focus on what matters.
